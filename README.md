# Eurorack Workflows

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows and tools for Eurorack DIY projects.

## Documentation

The unified documentation for all Eurorack modules is managed in a separate repository:

**[eurorack-docs](https://github.com/carr-james/eurorack-docs)** - Antora-based documentation site

Published at: https://carr-james.github.io/eurorack-docs

## Future Workflows

This repository is reserved for reusable workflows that can be shared across multiple hardware projects, such as:

- KiBot automation workflows
- Release automation
- Hardware validation scripts
- Common build tools

For documentation-specific workflows, see the [eurorack-docs](https://github.com/carr-james/eurorack-docs) repository.
